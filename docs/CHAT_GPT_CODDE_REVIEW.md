- Add *role/persona framing* to give the LLM more context and tone control.
- Break prompts into clear sections or steps using Markdown.
- Include *formatting instructions* (e.g., "respond in JSON" or "use Markdown").
- Add length or output constraints to improve determinism.
- Where appropriate, include *scoring rubrics* or structured evaluation formats.
- Encourage *constructive feedback* when asking for reviews or critique.
