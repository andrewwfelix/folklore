# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development progress, current priorities, and future plans for the Folklore monster generation system.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with separate tables for monsters, citations, art prompts, and refinement sessions
- **Agent Orchestration**: Complete agent system with Lore, StatBlock, Citation, ArtPrompt, QA, and PDF agents
- **Persistence Layer**: Robust database persistence with proper table relationships
- **Basic Generation**: End-to-end monster generation pipeline

#### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (Completed)
- **QA Agent**: Sophisticated quality review system with issue classification
- **Refinement Pipeline**: Iterative improvement system with feedback loops
- **Issue Classification**: Intelligent routing of issues to appropriate agents
- **Session Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of refinement sessions and iterations

#### Phase 3: Refinement Enhancement (Completed)
- **Database Persistence Fix**: Resolved statblock property name mismatch
- **Issue Category Handling**: Added support for all QA agent issue types
- **Refinement Loop Enhancement**: Included Minor severity issues in processing
- **PDF Generation Optimization**: Delayed PDF generation until after refinement completion

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

#### Phase 4: OpenRouter Integration
- **Provider Selection**: Chosen OpenRouter as unified AI provider
- **Environment Configuration**: Adding OpenRouter API key and model variables
- **Per-Component Model Selection**: Different models for different agents
- **Cost Optimization**: Using cheaper models for simpler tasks

#### Phase 5: UI Development
- **Next.js Dashboard**: Planning comprehensive UI for monitoring and management
- **Documentation System**: Creating centralized documentation repository
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates
